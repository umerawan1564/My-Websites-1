Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.</p>



<p>The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Bless up. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. Special cloth alert. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. Mogul talk. Congratulations, you played yourself.</p>
